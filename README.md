# Glossy

## An experimental blogging platform

Glossy was born out of my desire for more control in a CMS. In all the major brands I've tried, a person has very limited control over the way individual pages display. You can customize a post, and you can customize the number of posts shown on a page, but beyond that you have very little to say over the layout. Basically, in addition to being a web developer, I'm also a photographer and a writer. I wanted a platform that would let me build magazine-like articles, one page at a time. And so, Glossy.

### Features
+ Rich and interactive blog post editor utilizing Backbone.js over a RESTful Rails API.
+ Complex, drag-and-drop editable layout with nested views (in progress).
+ Nested form creates multiple model types in a single transaction.
+ Bootstrapped data and customized JSON serialization to reduce transaction overhead.
